# freeCodeCamp Algorithm Scripting

This repo contains my solutions for freeCodeCamp's algorithm challenges.

You can also check my other repo where you find [my freeCodeCamp projects](https://github.com/zsoltime/freeCodeCamp).

I've used Ava to test my solutions. You can use the following commands to test them yourself (once you cloned the repo and installed dependencies):

``` bash
# test everything
npm test

# test the basic challenges
npm run test:basic

# test the intermediate challenges
npm run test:intermediate

# test the advanced challenges
npm run test:advanced
```
