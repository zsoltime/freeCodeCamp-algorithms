# freeCodeCamp Algorithm Scripting

This repo contains my solutions for freeCodeCamp's algorithm challenges.

You can also check my other repo where you find [my freeCodeCamp projects](https://github.com/zsoltime/freeCodeCamp).

I'm using [AVA](https://github.com/avajs/ava) to test my solutions. You can use the following commands to test them yourself (once you cloned the repo and installed dependencies):

```bash
# test everything
npm test

# test the basic challenges
npm run test:basic

# test the intermediate challenges
npm run test:intermediate

# test the advanced challenges
npm run test:advanced
```

I'm also using [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) with [Airbnb's base config](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-airbnb-base), and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) to keep my code in good shape. You can use the following commands:

```bash
# lint using ESLint
npm run lint

# format code with prettier
npm run format
```
